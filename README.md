# dystopian-program Delphi7 / Access 2016
Introduction


Nowadays, more and more often the user turns to Internet resources to obtain the necessary information. Access to this information requires access to Internet resources, which makes it difficult to find the information. Also, finding information by the user can take a lot of time, especially if the information is located in various applications and sites, which in turn makes it much more difficult to find the necessary information.
The purpose of my course work is to optimize and combine information containing information about the Molodechno-Minsk route for such types of transport that use both railways and motorways.
The initial information was taken from Internet resources: the timetable of electric trains, the timetable of the bus fleet and the working hours of private entrepreneurs engaged in transportation.
To implement the project, I chose the Delphi7 and Access 2016 programming system, Help & Manual7.
To achieve the goal, it is necessary to solve the following tasks:

- Organization of the interface;
-	Database creation;
- Implementation of work with databases;
- Communication with the developer about problems and problems;
- Creation of reference information;
- Creation of Dll library.

The prospect of the project is that the program can be supplemented with other routes and modes of transportation. Also, the program can be converted into a mobile application, you can also create a site with information about the routes.
When working with this product, the user is free to decide which method of travel to choose, and also the user can, at a given time, determine the most optimal way of travel according to the information offered to him: ticket price, place of departure and arrival of transport, as well as the main stopping points of the transport route. The user will also be able to follow the link for more detailed clarification of the necessary information related to transport. In the program, it will be possible to contact the developer for a review or announcement of incorrectness in the schedule or in the program itself. The user will also be able to create his own schedule. The project considers that the cost of a ticket can change, therefore, it was decided to calculate the cost of a ticket in the Dll library. Therefore, when the ticket price changes, the ticket price will be changed in the Dll library.
